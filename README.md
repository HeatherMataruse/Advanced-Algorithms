# question description
Scenario: Matching Socks
The merchant has a big pile of socks from which she/he wants to pair up socks such that she/he keeps the pile as organized pairs of similar socks. Pairing up the socks will be based on the color (two socks of the same color will be paired up).

Interpretation

There is a total number of socks found in the pile and an array representing the colors of each sock. The matchingSocks function will return the number of pairs of socks. The socks with no matching colors will be discarded.

For example;

number of socks: 10
Array of colors[10] = {1,2,1,3,4,2,5,4,1,3}
Pairs returned: 4

Point to note: We have come up with 1 pair of color 1, 1 pair of color 2, 1 pair of color 3, and 1 pair of color 4 hence 3 pairs.

Tasks to be completed:

1. Write down the pseudo-code for the algorithm that will solve the problem.
2. Find the time complexity of the algorithm based on the pseudo-codes.
3. Implement the algorithm in a programming language of your choice. Finally, the program will be tested on some inputs and present the outputs.

Deliverables

1. A pdf or a doc file will be submitted covering the pseudo-codes and the time complexity of the algorithm
2. Codes will be submitted on GitHub. The GitHub file(s) link will be added to the pdf or doc file presented above.
3. Testing results will be explained in the document
